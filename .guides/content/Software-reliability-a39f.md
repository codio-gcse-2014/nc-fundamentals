If software fails then the effect can vary. 

| System Type | Seriousness | Description |
|-|-|-|
| ![](.guides/img/ico_table_pacemaker.png)<br>Pacemaker | Faintness or even death | If the software would fail, then either pacemaker would stop completely or it could send out pulses to stimulate the heart and an irregular or even  very fast rate, neither of which are comfortable |
| ![](.guides/img/ico_table_traffic.png)<br>Traffic Management | Traffic jams or even death | Traffic lights fail to operate correctly resulting in chaos or accidents. |
| ![](.guides/img/ico_table_gaming.png)<br>Gaming | Annoying | You are about to achieve your high score when the game crashes or freezes. Your life is temporarily ruined. |
| ![](.guides/img/ico_table_word_processor.png)<br>Work | Lost work | You have been editing a document for 2 hours without saving then it crashes. You have lost 2 hours of work. Other than testing, adding an auto-save feature can prevent this, which modern word-processors all have. |

## Testing
Software engineers spend a lot of time writing code with reliability in mind. The table below shows the various ways software development teams look to enhance reliability through testing.

| Method | Description |
|-|-|
| Unit Tests | All good developers incorporate unit tests into their development process. A unit test is code that simulates all possible or known scenarios for a discreet bit of functionality. A software program can have hundreds or thousands of these even. The developer then runs alls the tests to ensure that all test pass successfully. Any failures are higlighted. |
| User Tests | Software teams include *Quality Assurance* staff, whose job it is to follow *test plans* that tell teh QA person what to do. They can then check that everything looks right and behaves right, which unit tests often cannot do. |
| Emulations | If you are testing an in-flight control system, testing at 30'000 feet is not a great idea as any failures can result in death. An emulation allows the developers to emulate a real in-flight situation from the comfort of their desks. Only then does the software get tested in flight. |
