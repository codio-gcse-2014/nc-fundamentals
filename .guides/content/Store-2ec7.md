Primary storage (or main memory or internal memory), often referred to simply as memory, is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. RAM and ROM are the most common examples.|

Secondary Storage - Memory

Secondary storage (also known as external memory or auxiliary storage), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. A hard drives is the most common example although you can see there are many others. Secondary storage is most often *non-volatile* which means it retains information when the power is switched off.|
